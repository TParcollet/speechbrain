        The waveforms used for computing amplitude.
    lengths : tensor
        The lengths of the waveforms excluding the padding
        added to put all waveforms in the same tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    The average amplitude of the waveforms.

    """Use torch.nn.functional to perform 1d padding and conv.

    Arguments
    ---------
    waveform : tensor
        The tensor to perform operations on.
    kernel : tensor
        The filter to apply during convolution
    padding : int or tuple
        The padding (pad_left, pad_right) to apply.
        If an integer is passed instead, this is passed
        to the conv1d function and pad_type is ignored.
    pad_type : str
        The type of padding to use. Passed directly to
        `torch.nn.functional.pad`, see PyTorch documentation
        for available options.
    stride : int
        The number of units to move each time convolution is applied.
        Passed to conv1d. Has no effect if `use_fft` is True.
    groups : int
        This option is passed to `conv1d` to split the input into groups for
        convolution. Input channels should be divisible by number of groups.
    use_fft : bool
        When `use_fft` is passed `True`, then compute the convolution in the
        spectral domain using complex multiply. This is more efficient on CPU
        when the size of the kernel is large (e.g. reverberation). WARNING:
        Without padding, circular convolution occurs. This makes little
        difference in the case of reverberation, but may make more difference
        with different kernels.
    rotation_index : int
        This option only applies if `use_fft` is true. If so, the kernel is
        rolled by this amount before convolution to shift the output location.

    Returns
    -------
    The convolved waveform.

    Example
    -------
    >>> import soundfile as sf
    >>> signal, rate = sf.read('samples/audio_samples/example1.wav')
